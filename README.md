# Hackulator-4

## Inspiration

Our inspiration for the wish sender is ensuring no one is left behind. The holiday season is a season of a lot of joy, and through it, those of us who are in sorrow are often forgotten; we set out to change that this year.

## What it does

Our program introduces what it does and lists a number at the bottom of the site to ask users to text the number to start the program. Then it connects to the bot and begins the text messages. It asks the user what their New Yearâ€™s resolution is and if they will keep doing it all year. It will send gifs at the end and encourage them to continue their resolution.

## How we built it

We built the website using various languages like JavaScript and Python, as well as Wix. For Python, we had to import Twilio to have texts and replies. We imported Twilio, DateTime, os, and dotenv libraries to create the program. Then we followed the documentation on Twilio and got the program to send messages, take in replies, and respond with the appropriate gif.

## Challenges we ran into

A big challenge for us was implementing a data retrieval GUI in Wix. If we could have integrated our python code and the Twilio flow with Wix, there would have been more room for improving our design. With regard to Twilio design, the main difficulty was learning the syntax and semantics of using a bot. With lots of videos and research, we prevailed and began understanding how to utilize Twilio to our advantage.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are very proud of all the things we accomplished in this project since most of us started from scratch and had to start reading documentation before beginning. It was a fun and exciting process to see our product working as intended.

## What we learned

We learned new tech stacks and how to read the documentation and implement them. It was a lot of fun working as a team and collaborating on new things that none of us had any experience in. We felt it helped us prepare for real-life scenarios when we have to learn new things for companies.

## What's next for New year is coming

Our next move would be to improve the program and make it more automated to improve the user experience.
